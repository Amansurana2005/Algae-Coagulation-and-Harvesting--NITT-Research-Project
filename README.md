# Algae-Coagulation-and-Harvesting--NITT-Research-Project

Project Title: Research on Microalgae Harvesting via Electrocoagulation and Electrofloatation

Challenge: The research aimed to evaluate and optimize the electrocoagulation (EC) and electrofloatation (EF) methods for efficiently harvesting microalgae. The primary goal was to compare the performance of different electrode materials and determine the optimal operational parameters to maximize biomass recovery while minimizing energy consumption and environmental impact.

Methodology:

Experimental Setup: The apparatus consisted of a 280 mL microalgal broth in a beaker. Three electrode materials—Iron (Fe), Aluminum (Al), and Stainless Steel—were tested, each measuring 7.5 cm x 2.5 cm x 0.25 cm. The electrodes were immersed to a depth of 4 cm with a 1 cm gap between them, resulting in an effective surface area of 21.13 cm 
2
  per electrode.

Operational Parameters: The experiments were conducted in galvanostatic mode using a 30 V-10 A generator. Various current densities were maintained, including 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 A/dm$^2$, with the microalgal broth stirred at a constant 90-110 RPM.

Performance Measurement: Harvesting efficiency was determined by measuring the reduction in optical density (OD) of the algal suspension at a wavelength of 730 nm using a spectrophotometer. Samples were taken at specific time intervals (t=0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes) to track efficiency over time.

Environmental Impact Analysis: A life cycle assessment was conducted to quantify the environmental impact of the process. For one specific test with a current density of 3 A/dm$^2$ and a duration of 60 minutes, the energy consumption was calculated to be 0.0045936 kWh, which corresponded to a CO 
2
​
  emission of 3.766752 gms, based on India's emission factor of 820 grams of CO 
2
​
  per 1 kWh.

Results and Impact:

Superior Electrode Performance: The study found Aluminum to be the most effective electrode material, achieving a harvesting efficiency of over 90% in 60 minutes. This was significantly higher than the 21.5% efficiency observed with Stainless Steel. Iron electrodes were deemed unsuitable due to rapid oxidation and contamination of the biomass.

Process Optimization: The research demonstrated that increasing the current density led to a higher rate of reaction and improved harvesting efficiency. It also showed that a reduction in electrocoagulation cost could be achieved by operating at a lower current density, balancing efficiency and economic viability.

Quantitative Data-Driven Conclusion: The project successfully used quantitative data—specific dimensions, current densities, time intervals, and calculated emissions—to support its conclusions regarding electrode material effectiveness and process optimization, showcasing a strong foundation in scientific method and data analysis.
